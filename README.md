## How to use?
Comment V is content-aware so you don't have to choose your section type of comment. Comment uses `Kary Section Comment Width 80`, `Kary Section Comment Width 60` and `Kary Section InSection Comment` for start of your part and `Kary Line Comment Width 80`, `Kary Line Comment Width 60` and `Kary Separator Comment` for end of your section. What you have to do is to specify if the comment is start or the end of the section.

| Comments              | Keybindings           | Additional Information                                                            |
|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Flag                  | `alt` + `shift` + `y` | You'll have to also give it the index number                                      |
| Section Header        | `alt` + `y`           | Section Comment for Indentation less than 2 and InSection comment for the rest    |
| Reverse Section Start | `alt` + `m`           | _same as section comment_                                                         |
| Section End           | `alt` + `l`           | Line Comment for Indentation less than 2 and Separator comment for the rest       |

> __NOTE__ <br> These keybindings are chosen such that they are both easy to use within QWERTY and Dvorak layouts.
